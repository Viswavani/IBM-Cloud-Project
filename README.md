# IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies

This repository documents the capstone project completed during the **IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies**. The program was jointly organized by **Edunet Foundation**, **AICTE**, and **IBM SkillsBuild** to empower students with hands-on experience in Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing.

The primary objective was to solve a real-world problem using AI tools and IBM Cloud services through a project-based learning model.

## üí° Project Overview: Predicting Eligibility for NSAP

### Problem Statement:

The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) aims to provide financial support to marginalized groups. However, manual verification of eligibility is slow and error-prone, delaying assistance to the elderly, widows, and persons with disabilities. Each sub-scheme has its own criteria, making classification difficult.

### Proposed Solution:

An end-to-end machine learning solution was developed to automate the eligibility classification under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). The system uses district-level demographic and socio-economic data to predict which NSAP sub-scheme (e.g., for elderly, widows, or persons with disabilities) an applicant is eligible for. 
The final trained model was deployed as a RESTful web service on the IBM Watsonx.ai platform, enabling real-time predictions.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

* **Platform**: IBM Cloud

* **Tools**:

  * IBM Watsonx.ai Studio
  * IBM Watson Machine Learning
  * IBM AutoAI

* **Languages & Libraries**:

  * Python
  * scikit-learn
  * pandas
  * ibm-watsonx-ai



## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**: Dataset sourced from AI Kosh (district-wise NSAP pension data)
2. **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical fields, normalized data
3. **Model Training**:

   * AutoAI selected the best algorithm
   * Decision Tree Classifier (Pipeline 8) performed best with 96.7% accuracy
4. **Deployment**:

   * Deployed on IBM Watson ML
   * Exposed as a REST API endpoint
5. **Testing**:

   * Verified with real-time inputs for accurate scheme prediction



## üìä Results

* **Best Model**: Pipeline 8 ‚Äì Decision Tree Classifier
* **Accuracy**: 96.7% (Cross-Validated)
* **Training Time**: \~24 seconds
* **Deployment**: Successful as REST API for real-time classification


The system proved effective in **automating beneficiary classification**, drastically reducing human effort and improving speed and reliability in welfare distribution.
